[{"id":0,"href":"/gatekeeper-go/docs/modules/","title":"Modules","section":"Documentation","content":"GateKeeper Modules# GateKeeper is built up of a number of modules, each of which is responsible for a specific task. Some modules can be enabled/disabled using config keys in YAML, but the Router module requires the use of a certain binary/docker-image.\nThis is because the Router module is heavily reliant on the Netlink API, which is only available on Linux. Separating the Router module into a separate binary/docker-image allows for the use of GateKeeper on other platforms as a DHCP/DNS server while also making it easier to maintain the router module without impacting other features.\nDNS# The DNS module is a simple recursive DNS server that can be used to resolve DNS locally. It includes a local domain list that can be used to resolve local DNS entries (such as router, mediapc, etc) or just a way to override DNS entries as this local list is considered before a recursive request is made upstream.\nConfiguration# The DNS module is loaded if the config file contains the DNS key.\nBelow are the list of configuration options for the DNS module.\nKey Description Default Interface The interface the UDP socket will bind to eth0 LocalDomains A map of DNS names to IP addresses UpstreamServers The upstream DNS servers to use 8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1 Blocklists A list of host file formated files that will be used to block DNS requests BlockedDomains A list of domains to outright block DHCP# The DHCP module is a simple DHCP server that can be used to provide DHCP to devices on the network.\nConfiguration# The DHCP module is loaded if the config file contains the DHCP key.\nKey Description Default Interface Network interface for DHCP server eth0 StartAddr Starting IP address for DHCP pool 10.0.0.2 EndAddr Ending IP address for DHCP pool 10.0.0.99 DomainName Domain name provided to DHCP clients NameServers DNS servers provided to clients. If you have the DNS module enabled, you should include this device\u0026rsquo;s IP here LeaseTTL DHCP lease time-to-live in seconds 300 SubnetMask Subnet mask for the network 255.255.255.0 Gateway Default gateway IP address 10.0.0.1 ReservedAddresses MAC to IP address mappings for static reservations LeaseFile Path to file storing DHCP lease information /var/lib/gatekeeper/leases Web# The Web module is a simple HTTP server that can be used to provide a web interface to the GateKeeper.\nConfiguration# The Web module is loaded if the config file contains the Web key.\nKey Description Default Address Address and port for web server to listen on :8085 TLS TLS configuration for HTTPS HTPasswdFile Path to htpasswd file for authentication. If this is not included, the module defaults to username:password admin:admin Prometheus Enable Prometheus metrics endpoint. This is the same endpoint the DNS Statistics page uses, so disabling it here will disable that page false "},{"id":1,"href":"/gatekeeper-go/docs/getting-started/","title":"Getting Started","section":"Documentation","content":"Getting Started# There are a number of options available for running GateKeeper.\nThe easiest way to get started is to use the docker image, but there are limitations to each of the builds\n"}]
